# Yelp-Review-Data-Analysis-Using-Big-Data-Technologies
Designed a scalable data pipeline using AWS S3, Glue, EMR, and PySpark to process Yelp's dataset. Transformed raw JSON to structured CSV, performed cleaning, EDA, and built a master dataset. Extracted insights on business/user behavior and visualized trends for data-driven decisions.


#Objectives:
1.	Analyze Yelp business, user, and review data to extract useful insights.
2.	Build a recommendation system to suggest relevant businesses to users.
3.	Predict user ratings for businesses using machine learning models.
4.	Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.

#Dataset Description:
The Yelp dataset contains a wealth of information, including:
•	Business data: name, location, category, average rating
•	Review data: review text, user ID, business ID, stars (rating)
•	User data: number of reviews, average rating, and more

I worked on analyzing the Yelp Open Dataset to extract meaningful business insights. The project involved building an end-to-end data pipeline using PySpark, where I cleaned and transformed raw JSON data into structured formats, stored it in AWS S3, and performed queries to derive insights about businesses, user behavior, and review patterns.
