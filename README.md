# yelp-bigdata-analytics-cdac
I worked on analyzing the Yelp Open Dataset to extract meaningful business insights. The project involved building an end-to-end data pipeline using PySpark, where I cleaned and transformed raw JSON data into structured formats, stored it in AWS S3, and performed queries to derive insights about businesses, user behavior, and review patterns.
